NoiseMapGL is a project that generates and visualizes Perlin 2D Noise Maps using OpenGL. The project is written in C++.

## Features

- Real-time noise map generation
- Interactive controls for navigation and regeneration

## Controls

- **W**: Move forward
- **A**: Move left
- **S**: Move backward
- **D**: Move right
- **Space**: Regenerate the noise map

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
